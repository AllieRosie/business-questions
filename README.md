# business-questions
In this project, I use SQL to examine data of a fictional digital music shop (Chinook database) to answer business questions.

My analysis shows:
- Rock is the most popular music genre purchased by US customers, followed by Punk, Metal, R&B/Soul.
- The difference in employee sales was largely due to difference in their hiring dates.
- The highest sale was achieved in US (1040.5$), almost twice of sale in Canada (535.6$).
